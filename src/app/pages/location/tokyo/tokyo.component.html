			<p>The site of Tokyo has been inhabited since ancient times; the small fishing village of Edo existed there for centuries. Edo’s development into a city did not occur until the Tokugawa period (1603–1867), when it became the capital of the Tokugawa shogunate. During this period, however, the imperial family remained in Kyōto, the ancient imperial capital. With the Meiji Restoration of 1868, which ended the shogunate, the capital was moved to Edo. The city was renamed Tokyo, meaning “eastern capital.” Edo had been Japan’s largest city since the 17th century. Tokyo’s population exceeded one million in the late 19th century, and as Japan’s political, economic, and cultural centre it became one of the world’s most populous cities in the 20th century.

                The city is built on low, alluvial plains and adjacent upland hills. The climate is mild in winter and hot and humid in the summer. Early summer and early autumn are rainy seasons; two or three typhoons usually occur during September and October.

                The metropolitan area is the largest industrial, commercial, and financial centre in Japan. Many domestic and international financial institutions and other businesses are headquartered in central Tokyo. The city is an important wholesale centre, where goods from all parts of the country and the world are distributed. Tokyo is part of the Keihin Industrial Zone, centred on the western shore of the bay, which has become the country’s leading manufacturing region. Light and labour-intensive industries predominate in the city, notably printing and publishing and the manufacture of electronic equipment.</p>

				<h3>Senso-ji temple</h3>

                    Sensoji (浅草寺, Sensōji, also known as Asakusa Kannon Temple) is a Buddhist temple located in Asakusa. 
                    It is one of Tokyo's most colorful and popular temples.

                    The legend says that in the year 628, two brothers fished a statue of Kannon, the goddess of mercy,
                    out of the Sumida River, and even though they put the statue back into the river, it always returned to them. Consequently,
                    Sensoji was built nearby for the goddess of Kannon. 
                    The temple was completed in 645, making it Tokyo's oldest temple.
                    When approaching the temple, visitors first enter through the Kaminarimon (Thunder Gate), the outer gate of Sensoji Temple and the symbol of Asakusa and the entire city of Tokyo.
                    A shopping street of over 200 meters, called Nakamise, leads from the outer gate to the temple's second gate, the Hozomon.
                    Alongside typical Japanese souvenirs such as yukata and folding fans, various traditional local snacks from the Asakusa area are sold along the Nakamise.
                    The shopping street has a history of several centuries.
                    Beyond the Hozomon Gate stands the temple's main hall and a five storied pagoda. Destroyed in the war, the buildings are relatively recent reconstructions. The Asakusa Shrine, built in the year 1649 by Tokugawa Iemitsu, stands only a few dozen meters to the left of the temple's main building.

                <h3>Tsukiji Fish Market</h3>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 25px;">Tsukiji Outer Market (築地場外市場, Tsukiji Jōgai Shijō) 
                    is a district adjacent to the site of the former Tsukiji Wholesale Market. 
                    It consists of a few blocks of wholesale and retail shops, as well as restaurants crowded along narrow lanes. 
                    Here you can find fresh and processed seafood and produce alongside food-related goods such as knives.
                    A visit to Tsukiji Outer Market is best combined with a fresh sushi breakfast or lunch at one of the local restaurants. 
                    The restaurants are typically open from 5:00 in the morning to around noon or early afternoon. 
                    Because most of the fish served and sold at Tsukiji Outer Market is delivered directly from Toyosu Market,
                    this is one of the best places in Tokyo to enjoy fresh seafood.</p>

				<h3>Tokyo Tower</h3> 
                <img src="https://res.klook.com/images/fl_lossy.progressive,q_65/c_fill,w_1200,h_630/w_80,x_15,y_15,g_south_west,l_Klook_water_br_trans_yhcmh3/activities/fpvmhagjnclkdofmfqt2/Tokyo%20Tower%20Observatory%20Ticket.jpg" 
                alt="" width="400" height="400" id="hp"/>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 25px;">Standing 333 meters high in the center of Tokyo, Tokyo Tower (東京タワー) is the world's tallest, 
                    self-supported steel tower and 3 meters taller than its model, the Eiffel Tower. 
                    A symbol of Japan's post-war rebirth as a major economic power, 
                    Tokyo Tower was the country's tallest structure from its completion in 1958 until 2012 when it was surpassed by the Tokyo Skytree. 
                    In addition to being a popular tourist spot, Tokyo Tower serves as a broadcast antenna.

                    The tower's main deck at 150 meters is reached via elevator or a 600-step staircase (both paid). 
                    Thanks to the tower's central location, the observatory offers an interesting view of the city despite
                     being only at a relatively moderate height.
                    There are also some "lookdown windows" in the floor to stand on, a souvenir shop and a cafe.
                    A second set of elevators connect the main deck to the 250 meter high top deck, from where you can get a bird's eye view of Tokyo
                     from high above the surrounding buildings. It is the third highest observation deck in Tokyo (after the two decks at the Tokyo Skytree).
                      When visibility is good, visitors can see the Tokyo Skytree and Mount Fuji in the distance.
