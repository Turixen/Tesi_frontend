It is one of Tokyo's most colorful and popular temples. The legend says that in the year 628, two brothers fished a statue of Kannon, the goddess of mercy, out of the Sumida River, and even though they put the statue back into the river, it always returned to them. Consequently, Sensoji was built nearby for the goddess of Kannon. The temple was completed in 645, making it Tokyo's oldest temple. When approaching the temple, visitors first enter through the Kaminarimon (Thunder Gate), the outer gate of Sensoji Temple and the symbol of Asakusa and the entire city of Tokyo. A shopping street of over 200 meters, called Nakamise, leads from the outer gate to the temple's second gate, the Hozomon. Alongside typical Japanese souvenirs such as yukata and folding fans, various traditional local snacks from the Asakusa area are sold along the Nakamise. The shopping street has a history of several centuries. Beyond the Hozomon Gate stands the temple's main hall and a five storied pagoda. Destroyed in the war, the buildings are relatively recent reconstructions. The Asakusa Shrine, built in the year 1649 by Tokugawa Iemitsu, stands only a few dozen meters to the left of the temple's main building. \");\n      i0.ɵɵelement(22, \"br\")(23, \"br\")(24, \"br\")(25, \"br\");\n      i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n      i0.ɵɵelementStart(26, \"h3\");\n      i0.ɵɵtext(27, \"Tsukiji Fish Market\");\n      i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n      i0.ɵɵelement(28, \"img\", 5);\n      i0.ɵɵelementStart(29, \"p\", 4);\n      i0.ɵɵtext(30, \"Tsukiji Outer Market (\\u7BC9\\u5730\\u5834\\u5916\\u5E02\\u5834, Tsukiji J\\u014Dgai Shij\\u014D) is a district adjacent to the site of the former Tsukiji Wholesale Market.

A symbol of Japan's post-war rebirth as a major economic power, Tokyo Tower was the country's tallest structure from its completion in 1958 until 2012 when it was surpassed by the Tokyo Skytree. In addition to being a popular tourist spot, Tokyo Tower serves as a broadcast antenna. The tower's main deck at 150 meters is reached via elevator or a 600-step staircase (both paid). Thanks to the tower's central location, the observatory offers an interesting view of the city despite being only at a relatively moderate height. There are also some \\\"lookdown windows\\\" in the floor to stand on, a souvenir shop and a cafe. A second set of elevators connect the main deck to the 250 meter high top deck, from where you can get a bird's eye view of Tokyo from high above the surrounding buildings.
